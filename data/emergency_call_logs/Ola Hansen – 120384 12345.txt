Operator: Emergency services, what's your emergency?

Caller: Hi, I need help. I'm getting these rashes all over my body and they're spreading really fast. I'm really worried.

Operator: Can you tell me your name and location?

Caller: My name is Ola Hansen. I'm at Torggata 3 in Oslo.

Operator: Are you having any difficulty breathing, Ola?

Caller: No, not right now. But the rashes are really itchy and starting to swell up. I'm home alone and I'm getting scared.

Operator: Try not to scratch the rashes. When did they start appearing?

Caller: About 30 minutes ago. The only thing different is I used a new laundry detergent yesterday.

Operator: I'm dispatching an ambulance to you now. Can you make your way to the main entrance to let them in when they arrive?

Caller: Yes, I can do that.

Operator: Good. Remove any tight clothing and let me know if you start having trouble breathing. I'll stay on the line with you until the ambulance arrives.

Caller: Thank you. I'll go wait by the entrance now.
